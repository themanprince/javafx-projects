Hello, my name is Prince Adigwe and I have developed this software that allows you to create and edit files of any extension, depending on its contents.
This means that this program can only open files with certain extensions. For example, files with text in them (except pdf files)
can be opened with this program. this means that we can open your

* Txt files
* Java source files
* C++ source files
* Pascal source files
* Extensionless (Files without file extensions but contain text in them)

e.t.c

Basically any text file can be opened with this program.

The readme of this program was developed with the program itself and can only be opened with this program. *Smiling sheepishly*
